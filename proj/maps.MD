# Web application, Design and Maps  ðŸŒŽ

I have rich experience in design and quick prototyping of web applications. I have worked extensively with geo data / geo servers and developed mapping web applications. In design, I am comfortable with : { Adobe Illustrator : [work](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1637611388569890820), Inskscape : [work](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1637833666528149506), Adobe Dimension and Illustrator : [work 1](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1640346604510015489), [work 2](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1637608005876187139), Adobe Photoshop : [work 1](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1638159705947160576), [work 2](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1640153416109359104), Blender : [work](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1640407861049081874), Adobe After Effects : [work 1](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1652409719779106818), [work 2](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1653265276178145281)  }

I have worked with geo servers, fetching data (WMS/WFS), geojson and shapefiles. I did lot of data processing with geopandas ([work example](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1640628940292145153)) to develop custom geo data layers for rich visualizations over maps. In hackathons, I worked with open street map (osm) data via Leaflet, CesiumJS and TerriaJS. Here are some glimpses from project work at DPS, uTUM ( [work](https://twitter.com/florist_notes/status/1660018656439353355) ) and code from my training at DPS, uTUM in 2020 [ @/[flask-mapbox-cesium](../sysdesign/FLASK.MD)]. 

To develop web applications, I picked up HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap and MongoDb skills. I used Flask as backend and MapboxJS as frontend for mapping applications with MongoDB database.
