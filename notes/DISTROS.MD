# Linux Distros:

<p align="justify">

There are three main branches of Linux distros - Debian (deb), Red Hat (rpm), and Slackware (slp). There are also some smaller branches and some individual distros that have their own structure and setup. Some of these branches of Linux have large subgroups. For instance, Ubuntu is a large family of Linux distros within the Debian group. Some distros may stray far from their original group. For instance, OpenSUSE came from SUSE which came from Slackware. So, OpenSUSE is a descendant of Slackware, although OpenSUSE now uses RPM packages like RedHat-based Linux systems. So, that would make OpenSUSE a RedHat-based system. Some new major branches are forming. The Arch branch is starting to become as large as the three main branches of Linux distros.

<th>Parrot OS</th>
<td>Parrot OS is a wonderful penetration testing and vulnerability assessment distro that can do a lot more than some of its more popular peers like Kali Linux.

If you boot Parrot from a USB disk, you can choose to create a persistent partition to save your changes. Very thoughtfully the developers also allow you to encrypt this persistent partition for maximum security.<br /></td>
