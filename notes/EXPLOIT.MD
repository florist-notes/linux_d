# Linux Exploits

There is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel that allows users to increase their rights in the system. @[linux-kernel-exploitations](https://github.com/xairy/linux-kernel-exploitation) {[CVE linux vulnerability list](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-33/Linux.html)}

`Linux Exploits`:
Linux exploits take advantage of vulnerabilities in the Linux operating system and its applications. These vulnerabilities can arise from a variety of sources, including software bugs, configuration errors, and design flaws. Exploits can be used to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code, or disrupt services.

## Common Types of Linux Exploits :

+ `Privilege Escalation`:

    + Vertical Privilege Escalation: Gaining higher privileges than initially granted, typically from a regular user to root.
    + Horizontal Privilege Escalation: Gaining access to another user's account with the same privilege level.

+ `Remote Code Execution (RCE)`:

    + Exploiting vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on a remote machine.
    + Common in network services and applications.

+ `Local Exploits`:

    + Attacking a system from within, usually requiring some form of initial access.
    + Includes buffer overflows, race conditions, and improper handling of permissions.

+ `Denial of Service (DoS)`:

    + Attacks that aim to make a service or system unavailable to legitimate users.
    + Can be executed through resource exhaustion, crashes, or network traffic floods.

### Key Concepts in Linux Exploits :

+ `Buffer Overflow`:

    + Occurs when data exceeds a buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory.
    + Can be leveraged to inject malicious code or alter program execution.

 + `Race Condition`:

    + A flaw that occurs when the timing of events affects the system's behavior.
    + Often found in scenarios where multiple processes access shared resources.

+ `Symbolic Link (Symlink) Attacks`:

    + Exploiting symlinks to trick a program into performing actions on unintended files.
    + Common in scenarios where a program follows symlinks without proper validation.

+ `File Permissions`:

    + Exploiting misconfigured file permissions to gain unauthorized access or execute files.

+ `SUID/SGID Executables`:

    + Exploiting set-user-ID or set-group-ID files to execute code with elevated privileges.

## CAPTURE THE FLAG

`Capture the Flag (CTF)`:
CTF competitions are cybersecurity challenges where participants solve a variety of tasks to capture "flags" that are hidden in different challenges. These tasks are often designed to test the participants' skills in areas like cryptography, reverse engineering, web security, and binary exploitation. CTFs can be categorized into two main types: Jeopardy-style and Attack-Defense.

+ `Jeopardy-style CTF`:

Teams solve challenges in various categories to earn points.
Each challenge has a flag, typically a string, that participants need to find and submit.

+ `Attack-Defense CTF`:

Teams defend their own servers while attacking others.
Involves both offense (finding and exploiting vulnerabilities) and defense (securing systems and patching vulnerabilities).
